/**
 * VerZanctuary Core Package - Main sanctuary management components.
 *
 * This package contains the primary API and orchestration layer for VerZanctuary's
 * parallel version control system. The core components work together to provide
 * safe, timestamped snapshots of your project without interfering with Git history.
 *
 * ## Key Components
 * - [VersionSanctuaryManager] - Primary API facade for all sanctuary operations
 * - [SanctuaryServiceFactory] - Dependency injection factory for service construction
 * - [SanctuaryMetadataParser] - YAML serialization for sanctuary configuration
 *
 * ## Architecture
 * The package follows a service-oriented architecture where the manager orchestrates
 * specialized services that handle file operations, Git management, conflict detection
 * and workspace management. This separation enables testing, modularity and clear
 * responsibility boundaries.
 *
 * @see tech.robd.verzanctuary.services Service implementations
 * @see tech.robd.verzanctuary.path Path resolution and workspace management
 * @see tech.robd.verzanctuary.lock Concurrency control

/**
 * Service factory providing dependency injection for sanctuary service components.
 *
 * ## Purpose
 * Centralizes the complex dependency wiring required to construct sanctuary services
 * with their proper collaborators. Each service requires specific dependencies and
 * configuration - this factory encapsulates that complexity and ensures consistent
 * service construction across the application.
 *
 * ## Design Benefits
 * - **Dependency Management**: Handles complex service interdependencies
 * - **Configuration Consistency**: Ensures services receive consistent configuration
 * - **Testing Support**: Enables easy service mocking and test setup
 * - **Future Evolution**: Provides a place to add dependency injection frameworks later
 *
 * ## Service Dependencies
 * Services have a careful dependency hierarchy where some services depend on others.
 * This factory constructs them in the correct order and wires dependencies properly.
 *
 * @since 0.1.1

object SanctuaryServiceFactory {
    /**
     * Creates the core Git service that manages the underlying sanctuary repository.
     *
     * ## Service Role
     * The Git service is the foundation of the sanctuary system - it manages the actual
     * Git repository that stores timestamped snapshots. All other services either depend
     * on it or provide supporting capabilities for Git operations.
     *
     * ## Dependency Complexity
     * This is the most complex service to construct because it requires:
     * - File operations service for copying project files
     * - Conflict detection service for safety checks
     * - Path resolution for directory structure
     * - Locking for thread safety
     * - Logging for audit trails
     *
     * ## Path Resolution Strategy
     * Creates its own path resolver to determine sanctuary directory structure.
     * This ensures the Git service has consistent access to all required paths
     * regardless of how the factory was called.
     *
     * @param sanctuaryFileService Handles file copying between project and sanctuary
     * @param sanctuaryConflictService Detects potential conflicts before operations
     * @param workingDirectory Base directory for path resolution
     * @param lockManager Provides thread-safe operation coordination
     * @param sanctuaryLogService Records audit trail of Git operations
     * @param isGitRepository Affects how Git operations are handled
     * @return Fully configured Git service ready for sanctuary operations
