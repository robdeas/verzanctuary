/**
 * VerZanctuary - A safe sanctuary for your code versions
 *
 * VersionSanctuaryManager coordinates versioned code "sanctuaries" for a project,
 * without interfering with your main Git workflow.
 * which enables timestamped, isolated snapshots outside your main Git workflow.
 *
 * - Snapshots are stored in a parallel .sanctuary directory as a "hidden" independent Git repos.
 * - Allows restoring or inspecting any saved state, protecting your working tree.
 * - Not tied to Git history: ideal for "savepoints" before risky AI changes, refactoring, or experiments.
 *
 * Entry point for all high-level sanctuary operations: snapshot, restore, diff, cleanup, etc.
 *
 * Typical usage:
 *   val manager = VersionSanctuaryManager(File(".")) // from your project root
 *   manager.createSanctuarySnapshot("Before big refactor")
 *   // ... make changes ...
 *   manager.checkoutSanctuaryToWorking("auto-20250621-2345-01-123")
 *
 * This class should remain focused on orchestration; implementation details are delegated to services.
 *
 *  * Environment Variables:
 *  * - VERZANCTUARY_SANCTUARY_DIR: Custom location for sanctuary metadata (defaults to parent directory)
 *  * - VERZANCTUARY_WORKSPACE_DIR: Custom location for working tmp directory (defaults to VERZANCTUARY_SANCTUARY_DIR or parent directory)
 * *
