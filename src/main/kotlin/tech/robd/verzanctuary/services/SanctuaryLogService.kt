/**
 * Structured audit logging service for sanctuary operations.
 *
 * ## Purpose
 * Provides consistent, machine-readable logging of all sanctuary operations for
 * troubleshooting, auditing, and usage analysis. Each log entry captures the
 * operation context, outcome, and relevant metadata in JSON format.
 *
 * ## Log Format
 * Uses a line-delimited JSON (JSONL) format where each line contains a complete
 * JSON object representing one operation. This format enables easy parsing by
 * log analysis tools while remaining human-readable.
 *
 * ## Thread Safety
 * File append operations are atomic at the OS level for reasonably sized log
 * entries, making this service naturally thread-safe for concurrent logging
 * from multiple sanctuary operations.
 *
 * @param logFile File where sanctuary operations are logged

    /**
     * Records a sanctuary operation with structured metadata.
     *
     * ## Log Entry Structure
     * Each entry contains:
     * - **timestamp**: ISO-8601 formatted timestamp with timezone
     * - **type**: Operation category (e.g., "snapshot", "checkout", "diff")
     * - **message**: Human-readable operation description
     * - **result**: Operation outcome ("created", "error", "nochange", etc.)
     * - **branch**: Associated sanctuary branch (optional)
     * - **details**: Additional context data (optional)
     *
     * ## Usage Patterns
     * - Log before and after risky operations
     * - Include error details for failed operations
     * - Record timing information for performance analysis
     * - Capture user-provided messages for audit trails
     *
     * @param type Operation category for filtering and analysis
     * @param message Human-readable description of the operation
     * @param result Operation outcome indicator
     * @param branch Sanctuary branch involved in operation (if applicable)
     * @param details Additional structured data relevant to operation
