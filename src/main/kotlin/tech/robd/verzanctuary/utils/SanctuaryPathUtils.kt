 *
 * This is used to exclude such files/directories from copy and diff operations,
 * ensuring the sanctuary state does not leak version control metadata or internal working data.
 *
 * @param file The file or directory path to check (relative or absolute).
 * @param sourcePath The base source directory being processed (typically project root).
 * @param sanctuaryDir The main sanctuary directory (excluded from operations).
 * @param standardCheckoutPath The standard sanctuary checkout path (excluded from operations).
 * @return True if the file resides within a sanctuary-related folder; false otherwise.
 *
 * This logic is applied recursively up the file tree, so any parent matching an excluded
 * directory name will cause this to return true.
